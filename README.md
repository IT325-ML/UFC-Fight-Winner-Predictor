# Overview

This predictor forecasts the outcome (winner) of a UFC match based on fighters' performance metrics. 

Developed by **Sheen Ocon** during her junior year at the **University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines - CDO Campus** as a **BSIT** student, this predictor incorporates Data Mining and Machine Learning techniques to predict the winner between two players given their statistics, useful for UFC casual fans and MMA enthusisasts.
It is important to note that this mainly for entertainment purposes, but can also serve as an educational tool as well.
